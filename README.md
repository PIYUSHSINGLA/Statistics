# Statistics

### What is Statistics?
Statistics is a subfield of mathematics containing a collection of tools/methods that we can use to work on data to get answers to important questions about data.

Statistics is generally considered a prerequisite to the field of applied machine learning and is divided into 2 parts:

#### Descriptive Statistics
* Descriptive statistics refer to methods for summarizing raw observations into information that we can understand and share.
Commonly, descriptive statistics is the calculation of statistical values on samples of data in order to summarize properties of the sample of data, such as the common expected value (e.g. the mean or median) and the spread of the data (e.g. the variance or standard deviation).
* Descriptive statistics may also cover graphical methods that can be used to visualize samples of data. Charts and graphics can provide a useful qualitative understanding of both the shape or distribution of observations as well as how variables may relate to each other.

#### Inferential Statistics
* Inferential statistics is a fancy name for methods that aid in quantifying properties of the domain or population from a smaller set of obtained observations called a sample.
* Commonly, inferential statistics is the estimation of quantities from the population distribution, such as the expected value or the amount of spread.
* More sophisticated statistical inference tools can be used to quantify the likelihood of observing data samples given an assumption. These are often referred to as tools for statistical hypothesis testing, where the base assumption of a test is called the null hypothesis.
* There are many examples of inferential statistical methods given the range of hypotheses we may assume and the constraints we may impose on the data in order to increase the power or likelihood that the finding of the test is correct.
